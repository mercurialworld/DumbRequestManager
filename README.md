# DumbRequestManager
A map request manager for Beat Saber that abstracts out functions to an HTTP GET API, with a WebSocket API and Webhook API for real-time in-game queue event responses.  

Essentially meaning, any streaming bot you use (e.g. Streamer.bot, Firebot, MixItUp, etc.) now has request queue functionality -- so long as it supports making HTTP requests (at the minimum).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not a mod that is instantly ready to go, unlike most other request queue managers. It *will* require manual setup on your part. Filters, limits, so on and so forth will be something you add in the bot of your choice.

## Dependencies
Currently only tested on Beat Saber versions 1.39.1 or newer. Versions of the mod for older game versions are not planned at this time.
> [!NOTE]
> Some issues involving version 3.15.3 of SongCore may intermittently pop up from time to time. **This only effects 1.40.1, 1.40.2, 1.40.3, and 1.40.4.**
>
> 1.39.1 and 1.40.0 *(which use older versions)* seem to be stable.

# HTTP API
By default, a simple HTTP server is started on `http://localhost:13337`. Port and IP can be changed in the mod's JSON configuration file. A game restart (a hard restart) is required for changes to take effect.
> [!CAUTION]
> It is **NOT RECOMMENDED** to let this listen on a public IP address. Unless you know what you're doing, stick to `localhost`/`127.x.x.x` IP ranges or any LAN IP range (`10.x.x.x`; `172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x`; or `192.168.x.x`).

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are behind a firewall, it is **NOT RECOMMENDED** to forward the port you use for this HTTP server, unless you know what you are doing. Forwarding this means allowing anyone outside your local network will have full read/write access to your queue.

As this is really only a web server, you can test any of these endpoints in any web browser of your choice, while the game is running of course.

# WebSocket API
By default, a WebSocket server is started on `http://localhost:13338`, acting as a firehose (meaning it just spits out information, no input is taken into account). Port and IP can be changed in the mod's JSON configuration file. A game restart (a hard restart) is required for changes to take effect.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is **NOT RECOMMENDED** to let this listen on a public IP address. Unless you know what you're doing, stick to `localhost`/`127.x.x.x` IP ranges or any LAN IP range (`10.x.x.x`; `172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x`; or `192.168.x.x`).

**This is only used for button-press events to avoid feature creep with other mods adding WebSocket support for other data.** You do not need to use this if you don't want to or can't use it.

## Events
You can use these events in any way you would like to -- the intentions here are listed to explain the intended use of pressing the corresponding in-game button. 

| Event          | Intention                                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mapAdded`     | A map was added to the queue                                     |
| `mapReAdded`   | A previously actioned map was re-added to the queue              |
| `pressedBan`   | Banning/blacklisting a requested map                             |
| `pressedLink`  | Sending a direct link to a requested map                         |
| `pressedPlay`  | Playing a requested map                                          |
| `pressedPoke`  | Mentioning/poking/grabbing attention of the next person in queue |
| `pressedSkip`  | Skipping a requested map                                         |
| `queueCleared` | Clearing the queue                                               |
| `queueOpen`    | Closing or opening the queue                                     |

All `pressed` events and `map` events follow the same data structure:
```json
{
  "Timestamp": 1745374880148,
  "EventType": "pressedSkip",
  "Data": <map data>
}
```
`queueOpen` uses the following data structure:
```json
{
  "Timestamp": 1745374880148,
  "EventType": "queueOpen",
  "Data": <true | false>
}
```

# Webhook API

> [!NOTE]
> Webhooks are not triggered by default, you must define a valid URL in your configuration file (`UserData/DumbRequestManager.json`) before they will fire.

Some bot software (like MixItUp) support Webhooks, which will trigger commands once it detects data POSTed to a URL.

For valid events and their intended use, see the [WebSocket events](#websocket-events).

All `pressed` events follow the same data structure:
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1745374880148,
  "id": "33f0216b-bbed-4784-a9fd-aead73fae069",
  "event": "pressedSkip",
  "data": <map data>
}
```
`queueOpen` uses the following data structure:
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1745374880148,
  "id": "33f0216b-bbed-4784-a9fd-aead73fae069",
  "event": "queueOpen",
  "data": <true | false>
}
```

## Map data
> [!CAUTION]
> It is ***STRONGLY ADVISED*** that you do **NOT** show user-editable map metadata in your chat responses, [as BeatSaver has no bare-minimum filters in place for map uploads](https://discord.com/channels/882730837974609940/882730837974609943/983438702938300488).  
> 
> If you still want to risk it, at least check if any of the `CensorTitle`, `CensorSubTitle`, `CensorArtist`, and `CensorMapper` attributes are set to `true`. There are ways to get around these, of course, but the filters on DRM's side are bare minimum enough to prevent auto-bans on Twitch.
> 
> > (Also of note, Twitch viewers/users with the Moderator status do not have any AutoMod rulesets applied to them. If your bot is a moderator in your channel, responses will be allowed through verbatim.)

### (additional notes)
- `MetadataHasSplicedCensor` is a boolean indicating if an aggressively censored word was found spliced between multiple metadata fields.
   > (ex. if "apple" is censored aggressively, and *"c**ap**"* is the song title and *"**ple**ase"* is the artist, this will return `true`)
- `Diffs[x].BeatLeaderStars` will only be `0` if BeatLeader could not determine a star rating for a map, or if the map has been updated very recently. This will pull values from their own cached data, created every 24 hours.
