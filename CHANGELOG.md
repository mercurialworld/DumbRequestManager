# UNRELEASED [`0.6.4`]

## Fixes
- Fix markup error on map ID primary color highlight in song download popup
- Fix primary color gradients not reflecting changes to the primary color after a soft restart
    - this *might* not have fixed much, actually. probably only necessary for me.

## Changes
- Removed workaround for wipbot.com, as it's no longer necessary (see this [comment](https://github.com/Danielduel/wipbot-website/issues/1#issuecomment-3215786715))
